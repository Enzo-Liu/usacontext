-- Commentary: The positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an
-- arithmetic progression. Given that n is a positive integer, the equation, x2
-- − y2 − z2 = n, has exactly one solution when n = 20:

-- 132 − 102 − 72 = 20

-- In fact there are twenty-five values of n below one hundred for which the
-- equation has a unique solution.

-- How many values of n less than fifty million have exactly one solution?-
